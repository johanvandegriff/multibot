+links to each tenant on main page (view without logging in)
+login button on main page
+log in with twitch, session saved in state db, redirected to tenant page

EXISTING FEATURES:
+pop out chat
+super admin
+twitch authentication (need to split between containers and store sessions in state DB)
+channel and viewer properties system
+emotes from twitch, BTTV, FFZ, 7TV (global and channel)
+pronouns from alejo
+user can set nickname
+bot greets users by nickname, timeout for welcome and welcome back
+custom greeting for a viewer
+option to show/hide usernames,nicknames,pronouns,background in chat
+authentication on the data APIs to only work for the specific channel
+nicknames
+connect to twitch chat
+connect to youtube chat
+forward selected youtube commands to twitch
+connect to owncast chat
+connect to kick chat
+send combined chat to frontend (socket.io or websockets)
+send events to frontend (nicknames, channel/viewer property changed, channel enabled/disabled)
+clear chat command and api
+find youtube id by url/username
+twitch mods have permission to clear the chat with !clear
+!help/!commands currently a static message
+!botpage -> link to full page
+!multichat -> link to multichat only
+!clear -> clear multichat page
+decide what to keep/remove: !nickname !username !unsetnickname !setnickname
+enable/disable the bot on your channel
+timeout on enabling/disabling the bot to avoid spam
+gray out button when on timeout
+get list of all channels (any that have a tenant container, hardcode for now)
(skipped) need to revamp: CARL chatbot responds when @'ed, except by other bots
(skipped) prob dont need: random nickname if none provided
(skipped) prob dont need: get list of enabled channels and adjust dropdown accordingly, with super admin seeing all
(skipped) remove, no one uses it: query a nickname/username with the other

NEW FEATURES TO ADD:
+move proxy to main-container and delete router-container
+deploy on k8s locally with minikube
+able to query k8s data from within main-container with nodejs library
+able to spin up tenant containers from within main-container
+spin up tenant containers based on what's onboarded already
+easy sign up
+login directs u to either your page (if you are already in the system, how it works currently), or back to onboarding page where you can see the progress of spinning things up, then redirects u to your page once it is up (not returning 404)
+super admin can onboard and offboard any channel
+backend prevent onboarding if already onboarded and vice versa
+link to channel page in top right should not be clickable if not onboarded
+make on/offboard return error if failed to deploy to k8s, but app still works (e.g. running with ./run-node.sh or ./run-compose.sh)
+some way to enable channels in run-test.sh and run-compose.sh (enable whatever channels are in PROXY_OVERRIDES)
+issue with load balancer: one main container updates its routes but the rest have no clue - need to poll the channels list and update routes when one is added/removed
+need 3 successes in a row in wait_for_page

+deploy to digitalocean k8s and managed redis
+add https
+remove old load balancer
+fixed: not pulling latest docker in prod because of setting
+deploy new without deleting first for less downtime
+remove custom button since it cannot show arbitrary channels
+change multistream-bot to multibot
+move to the "multibot" namespace
+migrate data from v1 to v2
+deploy v2 on botbot.jjv.sh
+make jjv.sh all point to k8s and change TTL back to 3600
+move v2 to the main repo dir
+fix up README
+fix websockets
+fix intermittent timeouts (issue was deployment and service being named the same thing)
add cpu limits and horizontal pod autoscaling
redis backups

+keep track of version and if mismatch, send reload request
+auto reload if popout chat, otherwise ask to reload
+font selector: twitch font (current), discord font ('gg sans', 'Noto Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; check license (it was not allowed so found a similar one)), arial, etc.
+add text-shadow to chat: darken the background behind the text while keeping the text at full opacity
link to twitch, yt, etc. on a channel page even when not logged in
RTMP livestream splitting with 2nd tenant container
OBS container hosting with 3rd tenant container
probably not: owncast hosting?
text streaming with asciiradio that somehow forwards to video stream, maybe thru OBS container

standardize live chat connections
decent looking UI
    +copy from old one and fix up
    +better font
    +add padding and margins where needed
    better nav with search
    time duration picker
should a viewer be deleted if they unset their nickname? maybe only if they have no properties left (e.g. no custom greetz)
work with new https://pr.alejo.io/faq as well as the old version
maybe: viewer can set custom pronouns that aren't on alejo
+retroactively add pronouns to first message after fetched
use redis for last_seen with builtin expiration (but make sure to change expiration when thresholds are changed, or dont use them)
move emote and pronoun caches to redis
maybe: dedicated proxy containers for channel-independent tasks, e.g. pronoun/emote cache
maybe: temporarily add more twitch/yt/owncast/kick chats for collabs
maybe: move routing from main-container to k8s ingress or gateway API
+404 page on tenant-container
+404 page on main-container (figure out how to not interfere with dynamically added proxies and wait_for_page)
if a nonexistant page matches the twitch username requirements, offer to sign up
better logging (might come for free with tenant container docker logs)
feature toggles
maybe once feature toggles are added, remove the channel enable/disable since you can already onboard/offboard
toggle verbose logging?
handle display name being different language than username (e.g. porukun21) just check lowercase and if different, include username, unless nickname set (username becomes a defacto nickname)
admin feature toggle to enable/disable signups
option to pay for signups
option to split or combine chats
database backup and restore
database editor
twitch mods have permission to access the streamer's settings page
permissions system (super admin, streamer, mods, etc.)
maybe (prob not): should work if u dont have twitch (e.g. primary login with email)
at least add owncast as a primary login method
revamp CARL chatbot to be part of the system with moderation tools in place
CARL should be its own container that autoscales
random nickname if none provided
option to read out the chat with TTS
timeout on signup/delete account to avoid spam
make messages disappear after a timeout?
bot greets users without a nickname
onboarding tutorial/help button
custom code system with DO functions? or app platform? need live connection for efficiency
marketplace for plugins
integrate popular plugins into main code
change !nickname to !getnickname, and !setnickname to !nickname or !nick
maybe: provide ollama URL and API key (for me, running locally on laptop GPU, confuzer in future)
summary of youtube chat in twitch chat and vice versa? what about owncast and kick? maybe summarize all chats together and put in all chats
fun stats on main page

FROM PREVIOUS TODO:
//===PRIORITY===
//TODO public dashboard page
//TODO channel point redeems, bits, subs, etc.

//TODO test latency of DO spaces vs storj + minio
//TODO maybe migrate to app platform? or cloudways or k8s since they have better autoscaling. either way will require refactoring the secrets storage and chat connections
//TODO system to backup the data
//TODO bot able to post on youtube

//===EASY===
//TODO args to !multichat command to change the link, and tell it in message
//TODO link to source code on the page

//===BUGS===
//TODO failed to get chat messages after saying it was connected on the 1min timer
//TODO bot missing username when enabled and already has youtube_id ": connected to youtube chat"
//TODO bot keeps reconnecting to twitch chat, maybe every youtube check?
still skips some youtube messages

//===REFACTOR===

+rethink the api paths to something like /api/channels/:channel/nicknames/:username etc.
//TODO make it able to scale horizontally

//TODO allow mods to use the admin page for the streamer

//TODO bot respond to alerts
//TODO separate vip chat
//TODO commands in the bot's chat to play videos on the 24/7 stream
//TODO a way for super admin to call an api to get/set/delete anything in the database, for example delete last seen time
//TODO twitch badges
//TODO twitch /me
    context['message-type'] could be 'whisper', 'action' (for /me), or 'chat'
//TODO twitch show replies
//TODO do an actual reply instead of @'ing the user
//TODO !songlist reply on youtube - You: !songlist Nightbot: @You -> The song list for this channel is available at https://nightbot.tv/t/streamer/song_requests
//TODO when !songlist is typed on youtube, reply with `The song list for this channel is available at https://nightbot.tv/t/[channel]/song_requests`
//TODO summary of youtube chat in twitch chat and vice versa? what about owncast? exponential combinatorics as more chats are added
//TODO command forwarding from owncast to twitch?
//TODO publish bucket-db as a npm package
//TODO local s3 in docker with artificial delay time (& update README)
//TODO optimize getting enabled channels, maybe store it in the bucket at /enabled, where an empty file named the channel means the channel is enabled, and no file means disabled
